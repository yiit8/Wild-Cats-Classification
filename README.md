# Wild-Cats-Classification
With the usage of Vision Transformer i trained a model who classifies 10 wild cats.

Initial model's training losses-accuracies seemed fine but there is something wrong with
validation metrics. It jumps to 1.00 accuracy which is abnormal and impossible.

Will try to increase validation size and re-train the model to see if it works properly.
